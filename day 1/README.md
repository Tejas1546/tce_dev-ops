# 🚀 DevOps – Day 1  

## 📘 Introduction

DevOps is a collaborative approach that unites **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)**. The goal is to streamline the software delivery process through automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback—ensuring faster and more reliable releases.

This guide lays the groundwork by walking through the key stages of the DevOps lifecycle, highlighting core tools and best practices at each step.

## 🔄 DevOps Lifecycle at a Glance

The DevOps lifecycle is often visualized as an ongoing loop comprising the following core phases:

1. **Development**  
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
3. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**  
4. **Continuous Monitoring**  

Each phase contributes to a seamless and automated software delivery pipeline.

## 🛠️ 1. Development

**🎯 Goal:**  
Efficiently write, manage, and collaborate on code with version control and project tracking.

**🔧 Common Tools:**  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket  
- **Code Editors/IDEs:** VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse  
- **Project Management:** Jira, Trello  

---

## ⚙️ 2. Continuous Integration (CI)

**🎯 Goal:**  
Automatically build and test code as changes are made—catching issues early in the dev cycle.

**🔧 Common Tools:**  
- **CI Platforms:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI  
- **Build Tools:** Maven, Gradle, Ant  
- **Testing & Quality:** JUnit, Selenium, SonarQube  

---

## 🚀 3. Continuous Deployment (CD)

**🎯 Goal:**  
Push code to production (or staging) quickly, reliably, and automatically after passing CI checks.

**🔧 Common Tools:**  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes  
- **Infrastructure as Code / Config Mgmt:** Ansible, Chef, Puppet  
- **Cloud/CD Services:** AWS CodeDeploy, Azure DevOps, GCP Cloud Build  

---

## 📊 4. Continuous Monitoring

**🎯 Goal:**  
Observe system health, performance, and user interactions to proactively identify and resolve issues.

**🔧 Common Tools:**  
- **Monitoring Systems:** Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, Nagios  
- **Logging Solutions:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)  
- **APM & Observability:** Datadog, Splunk, New Relic
